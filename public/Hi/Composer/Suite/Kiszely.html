				<br />I started taking piano lessons at the <a href="http://www.mlc-music.com/" target="_blank" title="Welcome to the Main Line Conservatory of Music" class="Text">Main Line Conservatory<br />of Music</a>
						with Mrs. Joy Kiszely when I was 5 and <br />music theory lessons with Dr. Andor Kiszely when I was 6.	  
				<br />
				<br />They were tough, but they were the best.
				<br />(It was unusual for students <i>not</i> to play at Carenegie Hall)
				<br />
				<br />I certainly wasn't one of their "best" students: I would always
				<br />spend too much time screwing around on the piano
				<br />and not spend enough time practicingâ€”
				<br />but I guess this is how I first started composing music. 
				<br />
				<br />The knowledge of music that I have learned from the Main Line 
				<br />Conservatory of Music has given me the ability to 
				<br />interact with music today.
				<br />
				<br />But even more importantly, Dr. Kiszely taught me to
				<br />think logically and to always figure out, <i>why</i> things
				<br />are the way they are.
				<br />
				<br />I can still remember to this day,
				<br />"Why is the G-Cleff called the G-Cleff?"
				<br />One of us would raise our hands and say,
				<br />"Because it tells us where the 'G' is!",
				<br />proud that we knew the answer.
				<br />
				<br />Every day, I realize more and more that his teaching style
				<br />has made me into the inquisitive person that I am today.
				<br />
				<br />Today, I am never satisfied until I can answer the question,
				<br />why.
